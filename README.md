# 🏆 Competitive Programming — Exercises & Solutions

Welcome! This repository contains my solutions to **competitive programming** problems, focused on algorithms, data structures, and logical problem-solving.

The goal is to document my progress, maintain study consistency, and help other students and developers who are following a similar path.
